		<description><![CDATA[Hi Vivek,

I had emailed you about 3 weeks back asking about VISA procedure in India for YCombinator. We have been working on an idea for the past 3 months and had applied for YC Winter 2013 Batch. Unfortunately, we weren&#039;t called for the interview. We are really determined to pursue this idea and so would love to get some perspective from you regarding our project. So, Please let me know if you are free sometime towards the end of this month for a meeting.  I hear that you work out of Silicon Valley. We would love to come by and visit you sometime. If this is not possible please do let me know if you are free for a Skype call sometime soon.

Regards

		<description><![CDATA[Dude, really?! I&#039;ve constantly worked with foreign devs, from Russia, India, China, and Israel specifically. NOT ONE of the 50+ on my teams, even the doctorate guys, could code or build anything workable in a reasonable amount of time.

America and Germany have the best engineers, period.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well,I will completely agree with you Vivek.
&quot;Building what customer wants&quot; is only the reason behind of success of popular startups.
This was clearly explained in my favorite book &quot;The Lean Startup&quot; by Eric Ries.In this book he introduced several approaches in setting pivots in order to meet customer requirements.It was must one to read for all startup enthusiasts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vivek - I do think that &#039;iterating fast enough based on user feedback&#039; is indeed hard, even if you have a supportive team.  Almost on a daily basis you need to have a pulse for users reaction to your product. Not only that, you should be able to decipher users actions, and predict what&#039;s needed in the product to take it to the inflection point. I think successful co-founders really show their merit and camaraderie in such decision making situations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me (and aligns with) what our investor Jon C. from True Ventures always tells us - &quot;It&#039;s like Finding Nemo. You are chasing something, all you care about is the chase. It helps to be like a kid, honest, selfless and relentless and of-course, always surrounded by awesome kids&quot;.]]></description>
