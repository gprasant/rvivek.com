Here are six ideas that I’d love to see in action for which I’ll definitely be a paying customer. Some of them might exist and would love to know if they do, but most of them seem <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html" target="_blank">frighteningly ambitious</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[1] Smarter e-mail</strong></p>
<p>E-mail is hell and it sucks away a lot of productive time. As you grow higher up the ladder, it’s almost poisonous since you tend to be always on and not much of “real work” gets done. This e-mail system should be intelligent. For now it can just be a plugin but it should have the ability to</p>
<p>a) <em>Pause e-mail: </em>I should be able to set a timeframe where I don’t want to get any mail on my inbox unless it’s from a really important person. What constitutes a really important person is the AI logic that needs to be coded. It can be a combination of how frequently I mail the person, linkedin connect degree, importance of the person at this moment (for eg: if we’re doing a Quora CodeSprint that week, any mail from @<a href="http://quora.com/" target="_blank">quora.com</a> is high priority that week), etc.</p>
<p>This helps me allocate a chunk of time that I can spend on “real work” and once done, I can batch process the mails.</p>
<p>b) <em>Auto-send canned replies: </em>Things like ‘<em>What’s your office address?</em>‘ or ‘<em>What’s your phone number?</em>‘, etc. don’t necessarily need my intervention. The e-mail system should be able to automatically send those responses.</p>
<p>As you go higher up the ladder, scheduling meetings is a big pain and normally the assistant looks up the calendar, suggests a couple of time slots for you to pick. Again, the effort of an assistant is not needed. The e-mail system should be able to fetch my calendar schedule and automatically suggest times during which I’m free to meet.</p>
<p>There are many more processes that don’t need the my intervention at all and can save a lot of time (and task switch most importantly!)</p>
<p><strong>[2] CEO dashboard</strong></p>
<p>However easy, analytics tool might be, there’s always a need to use at least two of them (eg: <a href="http://chart.io/" target="_blank">chart.io</a> and mixpanel) This has in fact been a common topic in the YC groups and most of them have resorted to building <a href="http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/12/31/learning-from-2011/" target="_blank">custom dashboards</a>. This analytics tool or the CEO dashboard should work at the apache/logs level (lower abstraction).</p>
<p>Once this tool is installed, it automatically categorizes similar links/actions which I can tag. For eg: if this link is accessed then a payment has been successfully made or if this SQL query is executed (from the logs), a user has been activated the account. Since *all* the activities (web + DB) are recorded in the requests/logs, having a hook there to analyze all the data will be more accurate and gives the flexibility to measure whatever I want easily.</p>
<p><strong>[3] Summarize a video/blog to a few sentences.</strong></p>
<p>Videos are long and none has the patience to watch a 50-min talk unless it’s really inspiring. This tool should have the ability to summarize the video in the form of a text or a mind map or any understandable format to humans. Instead of watching a 50-min video talk, I should just see the output of this tool and gain the essence and important aspects of the talk in just 10 minutes.The same can apply to long blog posts/articles as well.</p>
<p><strong>[4] CRM inside e-mail</strong></p>
<p>When e-mail has become the default way to communicate between teams, it makes sense to integrate things as much as possible within e-mail. Bug-tracking, task assigning, support tickets and many more, tangentially rely on e-mail but we all use individual products for each of the things mentioned which becomes cumbersome.</p>
<p>Since everything can be tracked via e-mail and labels, this tool should be generic enough for me to plugin anything I need. For eg: assigning labels to users means it’s their responsibility to fix the bug or respond to the customer request.</p>
<p><em><strong>[5] Dating site for geeks</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s a common notion that geeks or nerds can’t talk to girls. Ironically, in my friends circle it’s them who’ve been able to have sustained and successful relationships. However a common pattern amongst them was, it took them a long time to take the initial step of asking her out. So, if we build a site that overcomes the initial hiccup, it should give them a good start to take off.</p>
<p>Here’s a site where a girl posts a gig related to computers/programming. It can be as basic as ‘<em>Help me move my posterous blog to tumblr’</em> to ‘<em>Help me code my lab assignment</em>‘. Once the task is done, since the guy has put quite a bit of effort she agrees to meet him in person for a coffee/lunch. Even though this might not be explicitly put up as a conditional thing, I’m guessing this is a natural extension once the gig is done. After all, there should’ve been quite a few conversations in the process.</p>
<p>PS: I just assumed geeks generally refer to guys, it can be vice-versa also, no chauvinist comments please.</p>
<p><strong>[6] Web language</strong></p>
<p>Every programmer has a language that he/she is comfortable with. I know a lot of programmers who’ve declined job offers (even though they loved the company) because the company was primarily using a different technology stack (Python vs Ruby) This happens vice-versa as well which is pretty sad because bumping onto a good hacker is getting harder and it’s definitely stupid to rewrite a large codebase in another language.</p>
<p>There should be a “<em>web language</em>” which all the interpreted languages get converted (and vice-versa) to, making it language agnostic. The ideal case is where a Python hacker and a Ruby hacker are able to add features on the website with the language of their choice.</p>
<p>I can see several problems here in terms of limitations of different languages and many more but after all these are frighteningly ambitious ideas that will make life simple.</p>
