<p>[1] Get a sincere office manager. At first it might seem like very little work for a full-time role. But an office manager position is like buying insurance. Only when the need arises, the true value is felt. If you&#8217;re running a company that has &gt; 5 employees with 50+ customers, I bet you&#8217;ll feel the need at least twice or thrice a week.</p>
<p>[2] Buy a big TT table with good racquets. Working in a startup is very tiring that you definitely need a 30-min break in between to refresh yourself.</p>
<p>[3] Get a powerful laptop to all the engineers that can comfortably run a VM, chrome with 10 tabs and a music player. Buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matrox-DualHead2Go-Digital-Edition-D2G-A2D-IF/dp/B000QRTHX8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1343609979&sr=8-1&keywords=matrox+dualhead2go">matrox</a> and ensure the development environment is <a href="http://linode.interviewstreet.com/rohan.jpeg">really powerful</a>. It increases productivity by a huge factor.</p>
<p>[4] Plan one day in a week to go out with the entire team &#8211; can be movie or lunch or anything that&#8217;s fun. Pick a slightly less busy day and get out.</p>
<p>[5] Get a cook who can provide at least two good meals a day. It&#8217;s okay if the cook costs 1.5x for a superior quality food, especially breakfast.</p>
<p>[6] Have a daily scrum for 20 mins on a time that&#8217;s convenient for everyone. Not only does it ensure everyone&#8217;s on the same page but also makes you work on something concrete. You know you&#8217;re being less productive when the scrum updates are very boring and generic. Fix the problem.</p>
<p>[7] If you&#8217;re a first time founder, get an advisor who will actually spend time with you and not just for name dropping. The advisor should be someone who has built a big company from scratch. And it is very very hard to find someone with those credentials. We were lucky! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jung">Mark</a> is such an amazing advisor to us and we meet every week for 1.5 hours discussing the most critical issues that has to be fixed and how to build a great company.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s worse than a failed start is failing after/when you&#8217;ve got enough traction. On day-1 of your startup, nothing really matters other than getting the company off the ground. The entire focus is on how to build something that users want. If you persist long enough, somewhere on the way, you will <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/emerging-businesses/startups/power-of-ideas-2012-start-up-interviewstreet-wins-us-government-order-to-build-tech-platform/articleshow/13859488.cms">encounter fame</a>, money, etc. Don&#8217;t let that bother you, just keep going like how you were on day-1.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rarely a conscious trap <sup>[1] </sup> and a lot of times the subconscious can make you think you&#8217;re smart. Now, you&#8217;ve to guard the newly achieved <em>smartness</em> which makes you act less dumb on certain occasions, unlike day-1 when nothing was at stake. The occasions can be pinging your advisors for help, believing that something will/won&#8217;t work, etc. Remember&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re being called obsessive to get something done, it&#8217;s okay.<br />
If you&#8217;re being called dumb, it&#8217;s okay.<br />
If you&#8217;re being called &lt;fill-anything-here&gt;, it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>The irony is, nothing matters if the <a href="http://www.quora.com/If-Steve-Jobs-was-such-a-bad-boss-why-did-so-many-people-work-with-him?srid=u2f">company wins</a> and it anyway doesn&#8217;t matter if the company loses.  So, it&#8217;s okay to continue being dumb and do things that&#8217;ll increase the odds of success.</p>
<p><em>Notes<br />

<p>I wanted to write a series of posts on my learnings in startups tagged as &#8216;notes&#8217;. So here&#8217;s the first one. Hope to write more.</p>
<p>A major criteria or a deciding factor for employee happiness is the people he/she is working with. High pay, bonuses, equity, benefits, etc are all just fuel to the car. The people in it should be great to actually enjoy the ride. Your employee will stay if she enjoys working with the people around.</p>
<p>Hiring takes time and should be a daily process. It&#8217;s okay to delay product deadlines to hire the right person. It is impossible to write a generic rule of hiring and who&#8217;s the right fit varies for each company depending on their ambitions and the founders attitude.</p>
<p>The way we hire is based on two things:<br />
a. If she had to do a startup, will I invest? assuming I&#8217;ve a lot of money.<br />
b. Will she make me look dumb on a lot of occasions?</p>
<p>If the answer to both of them is a clear yes and I get a clean yes from everyone else, we make an offer. This has worked reasonably well for us. But like everything else, we&#8217;re iterating. The moment you start trying different ways to retain an employee, that&#8217;s a bad sign. Somewhere you&#8217;ve made a mistake. Fix it right now.</p>
<p>Quoting Zuck, &#8216;<em>If you&#8217;re a CEO and not fatigued recruiting, you&#8217;re not doing it enough</em>&#8216;.</p>
