<p>Once you raise money, the default action is usually to hire more programmers to build fast and experiment more. Unfortunately things won&#8217;t move in the pace you expected it to. A lot of things fall into your plate &#8211; setting up insurance, payroll, a small kitchen, visiting the bank for a company credit card, buying computer peripherals &amp; accessories for employees, decorating office space &amp; many more. This leaves very little time to think about product &amp; hiring and hence slowness sets in.</p>
<p>The first hire to make is an <strong>office manager.</strong> It might seem steep to hire one when you&#8217;re in very early stages (3-5 people team) but it&#8217;s totally worth it! You can try part-time and see how much your life improves as a founder. Operational work in a startup is a disaster and time killer. And if you&#8217;re on a growth spree, it&#8217;s best to consider a COO. One of the very early hires for Square was Keith Rabois as a COO so that Jack could focus on the product. Vinod Khosla (one of our investors) keeps saying this &#8211; &#8220;<em>Any time the founder </em><em id="__mceDel"><em id="__mceDel">doesn&#8217;t spend on product or hiring is not worth it&#8221; </em></em>and is absolutely true.</p>
<p>The second hire to make is a <strong>founder&#8217;s coach. </strong>National &amp; international basketball teams have a coach. The best tennis player talks about how <a href="http://www.tennisworldusa.org/Roger-Federer-speaks-about-first-coach-Peter-Carters-impact-in-his-game-articolo8089.html">impactful a coach has been</a>, the best cricket <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report_sachin-tendulkar-s-coach-ramakant-achrekar-felicitated_1360127">player gets a coach</a> but not an entrepreneur.  Why? We mask under the term <em>advisor </em>but usually an advisor or a board member is a top CEO who has very little time for herself. An incubator/accelerator can help you guide only so much and is not realistic for them to spend focused time with you after you &#8220;<em>graduate</em>&#8220;. It&#8217;s the same case with VC&#8217;s. Their time is limited and would like to get just an overview or the health of the company and not every single detail. They&#8217;re always there for advice but can never be your coach.</p>
<p>I got to know that this role does exist in the startup ecosystem  when <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-hering">John Hering</a> mentioned about Kevin Hartz being a &#8220;coach&#8221; than an advisor. I later met <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jung">Mark Jung</a>. We met once in 2 weeks, then once a week and then twice a week before I felt guilty of using his time and made a formal proposal. He has been incredibly helpful in shaping the company and me as a better entrepreneur. Some of the things which are tough to do as a young first-time entrepreneur.</p>
<ul>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">How do you hire for a VP, sales role when you&#8217;ve never been there?</em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">What&#8217;re the metrics you&#8217;ve to be focused on? and how to improve them?</em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">How do you handle when an employee complaints about something gone wrong and you don&#8217;t know how to fix?</em></li>
<li><em>How do you manage/split time as a founder?</em></li>
<li><em>What are the parameters to consider to decide the compensation &amp; equity options for X?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">and many more.. </span></p>
<p>Sure, you can learn everything by trial &amp; error. But a coach uses his experience of building companies to guide you faster. It&#8217;s very hard to get a coach who&#8217;s willing to put in the time to your company but worth every bit to build a much bigger company.</p>
