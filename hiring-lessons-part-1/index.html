<p><strong>Speed vs hire<br />
</strong>Why does a company having 5x more programmers than you, move slowly or at the same pace as you? Apart from the overhead to manage more people, it&#8217;s the failure to maintain a high hiring bar that&#8217;s causing the slowness. I made this mistake. It&#8217;s a very rationale thing for anyone to ensure that the hiring bar is kept high. But why do we slip? or more precisely, why did I slip? Some of the reasons below may resonate with you. Let&#8217;s call the bad hire, Joe.</p>
<p><em>Insecurity</em><br />
I had an insecure feeling that if I didn&#8217;t replace the programmer who quit, immediately, my product would slow down, it&#8217;d affect customers, revenue would go down and so on. It&#8217;s bad to hire (or even interview) anyone with that sort of a mindset. It makes you twist facts, rearrange some of the evaluation parameters just to make that hire and feel &#8220;secure&#8221;. Ironically, all the things I feared started to happen, before I asked Joe to leave.</p>
<p><em>Size<br />
</em>The most dumbest way to evaluate a company is to base it on it&#8217;s size <sup>[1]</sup> and more often than not that seems to be the metric everyone is bothered about. The first question anyone (friends/investors/press) you meet asks is &#8220;<em>How big are you now?</em>&#8221; This made me feel weak as a founder since I thought I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;growing&#8221;. Thankfully I didn&#8217;t make any hires based on this but I did have those moments.</p>
<p><em>Betting<br />
</em>Someone with a really impressive profile  is interested in your company but doesn&#8217;t completely convince you. What do you do? I made a mistake of hiring Joe thinking he&#8217;ll eventually contribute because he has a strong profile. That never happened. The &#8220;eventual&#8221; in a startup is a few weeks or maybe even days.</p>
<p><em>Goal<br />
</em>One bad goal that you can set for the company is determining how many people you want to hire in the next x months. How many times have you heard a statement similar to this &#8220;<em>We&#8217;d like to double our team by next quarter</em>&#8220;. That&#8217;s a sure sign of lowering the bar at some stage in order to meet the goal. <em><br />
</em><br />
All of the reasons directly relate to desperation to hire someone to grow the company. It&#8217;s okay to wait for 3 months with a slow growth and then hire someone who&#8217;ll make the growth exponential to match the goal at the end of the year, than hiring when you&#8217;re not completely sure of.</p>

		<p>+1 to Insecurity. It lead us to do all sorts of things without really realizing the management cost associated with it, &#8220;Can&#8217;t hire in SF? Hire in London, setup Skype etc..&#8221;. Lacking empathy for other developers and the pain they will have to go through working with poor-developer/remote developers is worst thing to do to team and product.</p>
